dotfiles
========

Various dotfiles for configs and stuff. Not intended for use by anyone other than myself because they're the kind of ugly only a mother could love. Not that I am a mother, but you get the idea.

Also I can't be asked to edit the image paths and stuff.

awesome
=======
![awesome](https://raw.github.com/kirbyman62/dotfiles/master/awesome/preview.png)

It's a barely edited default, colours changed to match the 'darkcourses' colourscheme.

dwm
===
![dwm-red](https://raw.github.com/kirbyman62/dotfiles/master/dwm/red/preview.png)

My red dwm colourscheme. Pretty much everything about it is 'borrowed'. Font for the icons is 'stlarch'.

![dwm-blue](https://raw.github.com/kirbyman62/dotfiles/master/dwm/blue/preview.png)

My blue dwm colourscheme. Font is 'drift' from artwiz.
