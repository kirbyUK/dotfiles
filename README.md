dotfiles
========

Various dotfiles for configs and stuff. Not intended for use by anyone other than myself because they're the kind of ugly only a mother could love. Not that I am a mother, but you get the idea.

Also I can't be asked to edit the image paths and stuff.

![laptop](https://raw.github.com/kirbyman62/dotfiles/master/dwm/laptop/preview.png)

My laptop's config. The laptop runs Debian, and is mostly used in fullscreen tiling. Has the patches 'pertag' and 'status-toggle' applied. Icons are from the font 'stlarch'.

![netbook](https://raw.github.com/kirbyman62/dotfiles/master/dwm/netbook/preview.png)

My more minimal netbook config, designed for floating use. Doesn't use any patches. Both use modified keybindings to make them very similar to awesomewm, because I was too lazy to learn new ones.
